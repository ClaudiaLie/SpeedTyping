# Overview
This project is the submission of the second Milestone Project for Code Institute Full Stack Development course.

The project focuses on the use of JavaScript as main resource to create and Interactive Front-End website.
The website has to respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data.
To reach the project requirements I have decided to create a speed-typing videogame with a simple but eye-catching style and intuitive navigation for the user.

 In order to create a game-focused webpage, the "About" section has been deleted:

## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

* The website is hosted by GitHub Pages, a service offered by GitHub. 
To deploy a website from GitHub Pages the following steps must be followed:
    1. Create a GitHub Account;
    2. Create a Repository, an online storage for the content and files of your website, the name of your Repository must follow the naming convention of GitHub Pages (your-name.github.io);
    3. Use a Git Client (such as GitHub Desktop) to clone your repository and store it in a folder;
    4. Start coding creating an index.html file in your project;
    5. Add, commit and push your changes from your CLI terminal;
    6. After pushing your changes make sure your project is set to Public in the setting section and select a source branch to enable GitHub Pages to publish your repository;
    7. The website is now successfully deployed! The URL will be visible on your repository settings.
