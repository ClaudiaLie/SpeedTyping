# Overview
This project is the submission of the second Milestone Project for Code Institute Full Stack Development course.

The project focuses on the use of JavaScript as main resource to create an Interactive Front-End website.
The website has to respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data.
To reach the project requirements I have decided to create a speed-typing videogame with a simple but eye-catching style and intuitive navigation for the user.

# UX <a name="ux"></a>
## Objective <a name="objective"></a>



 ## Features <a name="features"></a>
 * Navbar with a "Refresh game" icon and a direct link to the Repository of the project on GitHub;
 * Instructions to the game;
 * Score and Time section;
 * A selection of quotes taken from an external API;
 * A header with a JavaScript animation.
 
 ## Colors <a name="colors"></a>
 The color scheme wants to resemble a Dark Screen Mode, to be more likeable for the user.

  * #9A98B4 - Main section background.

 ## Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>
 The initial hand sketched wireframes show a multi-section webpage idea, with a page dedicated to learning how to type faster:

 In order to create a game-focused webpage, the "About" section has been deleted:

 In favour of a responsive design for all devices:

 # Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>
 
 ## Goal of the Business <a name="goalbusiness"></a>
 * Create a fun and engaging game;
 * Create an intuitive website, user centered;
 * Create a responsive website so the user is able to play from any device. 

 ## User Stories/ Goal of the User <a name="goaluser"></a>
 * As user, I want to have fun and enjoy the game.
 * As user, I want to test my typing ability.
 * As user, I want to improve my typing ability.

# Game Logic <a name="gamelogic"></a>
<b>For pc users</b> it's important to build a game logic that makes the user not to touch the mouse or any other device but the keyboard.
That is the reason why the only engaging activity with the mouse is the refresh button, in case it's needed to start the game again.

<b>For mobile users</b> it is important instead, to create a game that is visible on the screen while typing.

The website is indeed playable even when the keyboard is showing on the screen.



# Testing <a name="testing"></a>

## Testing Details <a name="testingdetail"></a>

To see how the website performs on different devices:
* [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#)

To check the vadility of the website's code:
* [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
* [JSlint](http://jslint.com/)

To audit the quality of the webpage:
* [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm_source=devtools)

## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

* The website is hosted by GitHub Pages, a service offered by GitHub. 
To deploy a website from GitHub Pages the following steps must be followed:
    1. Create a GitHub Account;
    2. Create a Repository, an online storage for the content and files of your website, the name of your Repository must follow the naming convention of GitHub Pages (your-name.github.io);
    3. Use a Git Client (such as GitHub Desktop) to clone your repository and store it in a folder;
    4. Start coding creating an index.html file in your project;
    5. Add, commit and push your changes from your CLI terminal;
    6. After pushing your changes make sure your project is set to Public in the setting section and select a source branch to enable GitHub Pages to publish your repository;
    7. The website is now successfully deployed! The URL will be visible on your repository settings.
